## Oracle

-   Converted the [Manage Bill Management](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/financials/25c/faofc/overview-of-bill-management.html#s20068336) user guide from the legacy writing style to the modern conversational writing style. It was used as standard for the Conversational Writing Style initiative.
    
**Note**: The Oracle docs have probably been updated since I worked on them in 2019.
