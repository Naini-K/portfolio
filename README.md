## Oracle

-   Converted the [Manage Bill Management](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/financials/25c/faofc/overview-of-bill-management.html#s20068336) user guide from the legacy writing style to the modern conversational writing style. It was used as standard for the Conversational Writing Style initiative.
    
-   The writing style of these two topics adheres to the Oracle’s legacy writing style, which were followed before the Conversational Style initiative.
