Here are links to a few topics that I’ve authored for Okta and Oracle:

## Okta

-   [Non-human identities](https://help.okta.com/ispm/en-us/content/topics/ispm/nhi.htm)

-   [Okta Sign-In Widget](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/sign-in-widget/)

-   [Identity Governance](https://help.okta.com/oie/en-us/content/topics/identity-governance/iga.htm) (Redesigned landing page)
    
-   [Access Requests](https://help.okta.com/oie/en-us/content/topics/identity-governance/access-requests/ar-overview.htm)   

## Oracle

-   Converted the [Manage Bill Management](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/financials/25c/faofc/overview-of-bill-management.html#s20068336) user guide from the legacy writing style to the modern conversational writing style. It was used as standard for the Conversational Writing Style initiative.
    
**Note**: The Oracle docs have probably been updated since I worked on them in 2019.
